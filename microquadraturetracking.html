  <body> Quadrature counting with typical counter
    <br>
    <br>
    Quadrature tracking counters are a bit rare in the microcontroller world, and rarely more than one per chip.
    <br>

    <br>
    Using just io-pin interrupts:
    <br>
    Up to a moderate speed one can feed the quadrature signals to interrupts, and in each isr inspect the other signal to decide
    whether to count up or down.
    At high speeds the mechanism limits the ability to change direction, so after some threshold of time between pulses one can
    switch into just counting edges of one signal after recording the direction of travel.
    <br>
    As the mechanism slows down one can switch back to using isr's to do the decode. <br>
    If one is setting a motion breakpoint, for example to trigger data acquisition when a sensor is in position, one can figure out
    which quarter phase matters and use that to decide which edge is fed into the counter.
    <br>

    Using a timer/counter that has external enable and external clock modes:
    <br>
    <br>
    Most counters have an operational mode where they measure a pulse width, by using the input signal as a count enable. That can
    provide a speed measurement when using the isr to decode steps.
    When the number rises past a threshold then one has a quarter of that time to reconfigure the counter to count future edges.
    <br>
    Since the counter usually will only count up when externally clocked one must maintain the position as sign+magnitude rather
    than 2's complement.
    <br>
    Since the counter isn't as many bits as you should support you would use the counter overflow to increment and extended value.
    <br>

    <br>
    In all cases an index input must be handled as such:
    <br>
    In one direction a rising edge is the index location, in the other direction the falling edge is of interest. If hovering on the
    edge then life can be difficult, you will have to analog/debounce filter the quadrature signals to keep them from changing
    faster than the time it takes to reconfigure the interrupt polarity (unless you have a system which offers 'any change') <br>
    Nice systems guarantee that the index signal will be active slightly before and after only one quarter phase. If so then one can
    sample the index pin when responding to a quadrature clock (slow speed operation).<br>
    For systems where the index is sloppier one may choose to simple record index changes and not reset the steps counter. One can
    then use modulo math to determine the cycle phase. That works even of the steps counter wraps, so long as one implements the
    modulo operation to take that into account.
