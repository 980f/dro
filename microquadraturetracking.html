  <h2>Quadrature counting with typical counter </h2>
    <br>
    Quadrature tracking counters are a bit rare in the microcontroller world, and rarely more than one per chip. <br>
    <hr>
  <h3>Using just I/O-pin interrupts: </h3>
    Up to a moderate speed one can feed the quadrature signals to interrupts, and in each isr inspect the other signal to decide whether to count up or down. At high
    speeds the mechanism itself limits the ability to rapidly change direction, so after some threshold of time between pulses one can switch into just counting edges of one signal
    after recording the direction of travel. One can even just look at a single edge of one signal, counting 4 steps per event, resolving the 2 lsbs of position only when stationary.<br>
    <br>
    As the mechanism slows down one can switch back to using isr's to do the decode. <br>
    If one is setting a motion breakpoint, for example to trigger data acquisition when a sensor is in position, one can figure out which quarter phase matters and use
    that to decide which edge is fed into the counter. <br><br>
  At low speeds one must deal with jitter causing rapid interrupts.
  The easiest solution is to disable the channel that is jittering, with an extremist averaging it to get a fractional position value.
    <br>

  <h3>Using a timer/counter that has external enable and external clock modes:</h3>

    Most counters have an operational mode where they measure a pulse width, by using the input signal as a count enable. That can provide a speed measurement when
    using the isr to decode steps. When the number rises past a threshold then one has a quarter of that time to reconfigure the counter to count future edges. <br>
    Since the counter usually will only count up when externally clocked one must maintain the position as sign+magnitude rather than 2's complement. <br>
    Since the counter isn't as many bits as you should support you would use the counter overflow to increment an extended value. <br>
    <hr>
   <h3> In all cases an index input must be handled</h3>
    In one direction a rising edge is the index location, in the other direction the falling edge is of interest. <br>
    Nice systems guarantee that the index signal will be active slightly before and after only one quarter phase. If so then one can sample the index pin when
    responding to a quadrature clock (slow speed operation).<br>
    For systems where the index is sloppier one may choose to simple record index changes and not reset the steps counter. One can then use modulo math to determine the
    cycle phase. That works even if the steps counter wraps, so long as one implements the modulo operation to take that into account. <br>
  The index signal has the same jitter issues as the quadrature ones, sample it with the stable phase and perhaps average those samples over some short time interval.
    <br>
    <hr><h3>Range when using hardware counter</h3>
    When using an actual quadrature counting hardware mechanism one might have to deal with counter overflows. At moderate rates of speed there would be no jitter and
    one can look at the MSB of the counter to determine if the overflow was to zero or from zero. Although some hardware might retain a status bit indicating the
    direction of the last increment that status bit might at low speeds flip before the isr gets around to checking for it, trust the MSB.
  <br>When the mechanism is slow or stopped the same issue with jitter occurs as does for just using ISR's, with the same solution: ignore that phase at hardware level, with perhaps random sampling it to get a "most likely" value.
    <br>
    If one tracks 'time since last rollover interrupt' one could detect this and disable that phase, only tracking the other for a bit. Noting two rollovers in the same
    direction close together implies a missed transition.<br>
    <br>
    One can also fix the damn motor to not do this. Any such jitter is due to an overreactive PID loop (ignoring the case of an oscillatory external force, such as
    building vibrations given we are talking 100kHZ or so being needed for this to be a problem). One can choose to set the PID to low P + high I when one is standing
    still.<br>
  <br> One can use a GPIO pin and a resistor to create software mediated hysteresis to reduce sensor jitter when sitting on an edge, to such a degree that any remaining is due to mechanical significance.
  <hr><h3>Using two counters (no hw quadrature)</h3>
  One may use two counters, with external logic sending "count up" to one and "count down" to the other. Software takes the difference to get the actual position.

  <br>Actually ... having complementary timers running on each quadrature signal leads to easy resolution of jitter when stopped. If one channel is changing rapidly and the other not at all then squelch the changing channel.

  <hr>
  <h3>Speed considerations:</h3>
  Tracks with 1 or 5 uM per tick are common, as are 0.05/0.1 mils.
  <br>A job speed of 1 foot per second seems adequate for manual milling, which is what this product is targeted at.
  <br>30 cm/s = 300 mm/sec = 300,000 um/sec.
  <br>If each tick is one fourth of a cycle then each signal runs at 75,000 per second, 150,000 if reacting to both edges.
  <br>A cortex-M3 takes around 30 clocks to do a minimal quadrature implementing interrupt handler, 30 clocks @64MHz = ~2 Million ticks per second possible. Divide that by 150k and you get greater than 13 channels supportable.<br>If we track both signals divide that by 2.
  <br>That means we can handle quadrature tracking for 3 devices, tracking both channels, w/ a 64Mhz CM3 and still have nearly 50% cpu time for talking to the host. If we use DMA for uarts and the like then that is quite easy to make work.
  <br><br>Esp32 interrupt latency: the WiFi support via FreeRTOS makes this device not suitable for this use. IE it is hard to find the documentation necessary to write the interrupt handler as one must reserve resources from FreeRTOS. FreeRTOS supported interrupt handling might keep up with one channel, but at 2uS just for latency it would be hard to trust it. And since that means we won't be burdening our quadrature sensing processor with the wireless interface, we might as well use an STM32 processor and keep this all very simple.

  <h3>Raspberry Pi Pico PIO device usage:</h3>
  The 2 bits of input cycle between 00,01,11,10 either forwards or backwards. If we use the PIO program counter to track these we can have two separate units whose counts are then merged by the host processor (CM0+).
  <br>Each tracker toggles between states looking for 1 and looking for 0.
  <pre>
    //increment just on forward as determined by A signal
    wrap_target:
    mov x to OSR   //OSR updates on both edges of A, even though we only alter X on one of those edges.
    wait on GPIO pin 'A' low
    wait on GPIO pin 'A' high  //pin selected by opcode
    jmp on 'B' pin (high) to wrap_target //pin selected by configuration register
    x--     //via test instruction with 'next' as target, else could implement an overflow detection.
    wrap.
  </pre>
  <br>The host polls the value via inserting a "PUSH" followed by reading the fifo. A second state machine would swap A and B pin usages and y for x, the host then takes the difference between the two readings to get the actual position.
  <br>The least 2 bits of precision are only meaningful when the load is barely moving in which case one looks at the GPIO inputs directly, remembering to do grey code conversions on the lsbs.
  <br> The loop is a nominal 3 clocks per worst phase, but there is synchronization hardware which can add 2 clocks making the maximum rate so we need 5 clocks per phase, 10 clocks overall, or ~12M cycles per second which is quite fast enough. This is a pessimistic analysis, the synch delay affects rising as well as falling and as such will probably work out as adding only a single clock additional delay.
  <br>

  <h3>range considerations</h3>
  At 1 um per tick 65536 ticks is only 65 mm, 6.5 cm, a few inches.
  <br>Even at the less demanding 5um that is only about 12 inches. That means we really need to have at least 24 bits of range. This is especially the case for stm32's quadrature hardware. It has a prescalar, but you can't read the bits from it so you lose resolution when you gain range.
