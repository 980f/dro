  <body> Quadrature counting with typical counter <br>
    <br>
    Quadrature tracking counters are a bit rare in the microcontroller world, and rarely more than one per chip. <br>
    --- <br>
    Using just io-pin interrupts: <br>
    At low speeds one should poll as jitter can cause rapid interrupts.<br>
    <br>
    Up to a moderate speed one can feed the quadrature signals to interrupts, and in each isr inspect the other signal to decide whether to count up or down. At high
    speeds the mechanism limits the ability to change direction, so after some threshold of time between pulses one can switch into just counting edges of one signal
    after recording the direction of travel. <br>
    <br>
    As the mechanism slows down one can switch back to using isr's to do the decode. <br>
    If one is setting a motion breakpoint, for example to trigger data acquisition when a sensor is in position, one can figure out which quarter phase matters and use
    that to decide which edge is fed into the counter. <br>
    <br>
    --- <br>
    Using a timer/counter that has external enable and external clock modes: <br>
    <br>
    Most counters have an operational mode where they measure a pulse width, by using the input signal as a count enable. That can provide a speed measurement when
    using the isr to decode steps. When the number rises past a threshold then one has a quarter of that time to reconfigure the counter to count future edges. <br>
    Since the counter usually will only count up when externally clocked one must maintain the position as sign+magnitude rather than 2's complement. <br>
    Since the counter isn't as many bits as you should support you would use the counter overflow to increment and extended value. <br>
    --- <br>
    In all cases an index input must be handled as such: <br>
    In one direction a rising edge is the index location, in the other direction the falling edge is of interest. If hovering on the edge then life can be difficult,
    you will have to analog/debounce filter the quadrature signals to keep them from changing faster than the time it takes to reconfigure the interrupt polarity
    (unless you have a system which offers 'any change') <br>
    Nice systems guarantee that the index signal will be active slightly before and after only one quarter phase. If so then one can sample the index pin when
    responding to a quadrature clock (slow speed operation).<br>
    For systems where the index is sloppier one may choose to simple record index changes and not reset the steps counter. One can then use modulo math to determine the
    cycle phase. That works even of the steps counter wraps, so long as one implements the modulo operation to take that into account. <br>
    <br>
    <hr><br>
    When using an actual quadrature counting hardware mechanism one might have to deal with counter overflows. At moderate rates of speed there would be no jitter and
    one can look at the MSB of the counter to determine if the overflow was to zero or from zero. Although some hardware might retain a status bit indicating the
    direction of the last increment that might at low speeds flip before the isr gets around to checking for it, trust the MSB. If the mechanism is going very slow, and
    especially when nominally stopped, one can get rapid rollovers as the encoder rocks around the 64k/0 step (for 16 bit counter). One must drop use of the counter and
    go to polling the pins in order to debounce that. <br>
    <br>
    If one tracks 'time since last rollover interrupt' one could detect this and disable that phase, only tracking the other for a bit. Noting two rollovers in the same
    direction close together implies a missed transition.<br>
    <br>
    One can also fix the damn motor to not do this. Any such jitter is due to an overreactive PID loop (ignoring the case of an oscillatory external force, such as
    building vibrations given we are talking 100kHZ or so being needed for this to be a problem). One can choose to set the PID to low P + high I when one is standing
    still.
