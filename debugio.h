  * rowley crossstudio debug printer works via storing some constants in your program

  * the program binary rather than using the debug hardware).
  *
  * upon recognizing that particular breakpoint they use debug access to get the printf
  * arguments, collect the data, then format it on the PC running the IDE.
  *
  * If you enable their debug stuff then if the jtag debugger is not installed your program will
  * freeze hard.
