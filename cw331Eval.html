    <p>crosstudio 3.3.1 evaluation</p>
    <p>likes</p>
    <ol>
      <li>license locked to usb ethernet adapter. My eval computer is on its
        last legs, it will be nice to be able to move to different computers.</li>
      <li>user interaction seems more responsive than 1.17, 2.x versions (I used
        crossstudio extensively in 2009&amp;2010 but not much since then.)</li>
      <li>up-to-date version of compiler: I am heavily invested in template
        programming to do type and range checking at compile time, as opposed to
        most of the world still using typeless #defines and trusting themselves
        to not use wrong arguments.</li>
      <li>similar enough to past versions that my hacks are still relevant, such
        as rolling my own startup and linker scripts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>actual bugs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>UI-annoying: clicking on linker error tries to display the linker
        executable, the linker script would seem to be a better choice (or do
        nothing since the error is correctly marked in the ld file). Sometimes
        this attempt to view the ld executable pops up automatically.</li>
      <li>usability-medium: the error view is brought forward but is empty
        despite the output view showing there are errors. I then have to switch
        to the output view and drill down the tree to get to the error content.</li>
      <li>text editor-minor: unhandled control keys become ordinary keys: ctrl-
        is '-' (expected font to shrink), ctrl. is '.' instead of halting
        execution. (since 1.17!)</li>
      <li>bug-middling:"Entry Symbol=none" still emits -e making next
        commandline arg be the entry symbol. I don't need an entry symbol so I
        shouldn't have to dummy one up.</li>
      <li>build-minor: '-u_vector' is put into ld commandline, but I am not
        using that for my vector table (using KEEP's instead). This used to be
        accessible from the properties editor but I can't find it therein.</li>
      <li>package error: "cannot find
        /home/andyh/.rowley_associates_limited/CrossWorks for
        ARM/v3/packages/targets/LPC1000/lib/liblpc1000_v7m_t_le_eabi_f_swc.a: No
        such file or directory"<br>
        'small' is present, but no 'swc' variant. I selected 'treat double as
        float', don't know which other properties affect lib selection. The lib
        wasn't useful to me at this time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>annoyances:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>could not find project property for pre-processor defines, had to hack
        the xml and copy section from configuration block after which the option
        appeared under the project.</li>
      <li>file selection for project manager resolved symbolic links, subverting
        the point in having such links. EG: I put a link under my project source
        dir to point to a library that was in a different git repo. I'd like to
        be able to move around where that other repo is via changing the OS link
        without having to do a search and replace in my project files.</li>
      <li>Flash can be at two different addresses, either 0 or 128M on my stm32
        part. Apparently you enforce values from your xml target description,
        rather than trusting the linker. It would be handy if this check could
        be suppressed, or I shall experiment with adding another section to see
        if that is good enough.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>UI annoyances:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>with every C level debug step the memory window was scrolled back to
        its left margin, requiring me to yank it back each and every step to see
        the value I wanted. You should not be automatedly fooling with window
        scrollbars, that is extremely painful to deal with. Over the years
        crossworks also has had a tendency to change the expansion state of a
        tree with every step into another function and return, that also makes
        my wrists ache during any extended debug session and is a major time
        killer and distraction. And ditto that for the display format of members
        of a struct or a local variable.<br>
        Summary: View state should not be altered during a data update, view
        state of locals should be remembered by function, not in sync with the
        stack as it executes.</li>
      <li>tedious: after breaking debug: frequently prompted to find a header
        file, even when the file open dialog has that file handy. Doesn't
        remember these selections very long, makes debug sessions tedious. I
        believe I can add header files to the project file, but as indicated by
        your "open include" right click menu you can sometimes&nbsp; find the
        files yourself.</li>
      <li>can't set breakpoint while download is going on. I understand that the
        jtag interface is a bit busy, but you could allow the local list of
        breakpoints to be edited while the download is proceeding. It is very
        normal that I hit "F5/Start Debug" *then* realize I need to set a
        breakpoint before execution begins (or restart the debug session).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Feature Requests</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Call Stack presently doesn't unwind past a hardware fault, presume the
        same for regular interrupts. The 'interrupt stack frame' is well
        defined, you should be able to get us back to the line of code causing
        the exception (presuming it is 'synchronous').</li>
      <li>allow placing backup files in another directory, instead of same
        directory as file, to reduce clutter when browsing the source with a
        file manager, especially useful when grepping for something- you only
        get hits in files that matter without having to use a fancy glob ('.h'
        or '.cpp'). The same would be nice for autosave files.</li>
      <li>open file dialog: should watch for files being added (by external
        actions)</li>
      <li>open file dialog: should remember last file filter, or allow you to
        configure a default. The existing default is wrong 100% of the time for
        me, at least when invoked by ^O. It seems that sometimes it remembers,
        sometimes not. It recently got obsessed with .ld files.</li>
      <li>build: concatenation of configuration names is done with a space char,
        making commandline file management annoying. I text edit the hzp to
        replace the space with a dash.</li>
      <li>An option for "no heap", versus me chasing down HEAPSIZE and setting
        it to 0. I don't allow any dynamic allocation in microcontroller code
        and I want the link to fail hard if something tries.</li>
      <li>An option for "maximum stack", drops all the stack stuff from the
        linker other than setting the stack init value in the vector table to
        top of ram.</li>
      <li>precalculate ram allocations and use that to put stack at start of ram
        segment, so that stack overflow is a hardfault. I haven't yet been able
        to convince the linker to do that for me, attempts to size the data
        segment consume all the input sections.</li>
      <li>would like to easily disable or hide all printf/scanf/widechar
        functionality, perhaps hide them when 'use standard libraries' is
        disabled. OR tell me how to build my own configuration templates so that
        I quit having
        things I never use urged on me when building a new project.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>previous version bugs to confirm:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>BUG: debug view displays base class data from address offset, rather
        than this+offset.</li>
      <li>gui: menu popup can be off screen, greatly reducing their utility.
        Tested with dual monitor system with a tall monitor on the left and a
        shorter monitor on the right. Seems to presume that the monitors are all
        the same height.</li>
      <li>gui: see above- case is cycle counter right click menu, all off screen
        except for enough to tell that a menu is present.</li>
      <li>gui: with a large project opening up the dependent files node of the
        last entry pushed its content off screen</li>
    </ol>
