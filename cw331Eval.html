    <p>crosstudio 3.3.1 evaluation</p>
    <p>likes</p>
    <ol>
      <li>license locked to removal usb ethernet adapter. My eval computer is on
        its last legs, it will be nice to be able to move to different
        computers.</li>
      <li>user interaction seems smoother than 1.17, 2.0 versions (I used
        crossstudio extensively in 2009&amp;2010 but not much since then.)</li>
      <li>up-to-date version of compiler: I am heavily invested in template
        programming to do type and range checking at compile time, as opposed to
        most of the world still using typeless #defines and trusting themselves
        to not use wrong arguments.</li>
      <li>similar enough to past versions that my hacks are still relevant, such
        as rolling my own startup and linker scripts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>dislikes</p>
    <ol>
      <li>bug: clicking on linker error tries to display the linker executable,
        the linker script would seem to be a better choice (or do nothing since
        the error is correctly marked in the ld file). Sometimes this attempt to
        view the ld executable pops up automatically.</li>
      <li>usability: the error view is brought forward but is empty despite the
        output view showing there are errors. I then have to switch to the
        output view and drill down the tree to get to the error content.</li>
      <li>RFI: Call Stack&nbsp; doesn't unwind past a hardware fault, presume
        the same for regular interrupts. The 'interrupt stack frame' is well
        defined, you should be able to get us back to the line of code causing
        the exception (presuming it is 'synchronous').</li>
      <li>usability: could not find project property for pre-processor defines,
        had to hack the xml and copy section from configuration block after
        which the option appeared under the project.</li>
      <li>bug: file selection for project manager resolved symbolic links,
        subverting the point in having such links. EG: I put a link under my
        project source dir to point to a library that was in a different git
        repo. I'd like to be able to move around where that other repo is via
        changing the OS link without having to do a search and replace in my
        project files.</li>
      <li>RFI: would like to easily disable or hide all printf/scanf/widechar
        functionality, perhaps hide them when 'use standard libraries' is
        disabled. OR build my own configuration templates so that I quit having
        them shoved into my face when building a new project.</li>
      <li>RFI: "no heap" setting, no heap allocation (or symbol stuffing) and
        stack is set to remainder of SRAM segment (via startup in my case)</li>
      <li>RFI: precalculate ram allocations and use that to put stack at start
        of ram segment, so that stack overflow is a hardfault.</li>
      <li>text editor: unhandled control keys become ordinary keys: ctrl- is '-'
        (expected font to shrink), ctrl. is '.' instead of halting execution.
        (since 1.17!)</li>
      <li>build: concatenation of configuration names is done with a space char,
        making commandline file management annoying. I text edit the hzp to
        replace the space with a dash.</li>
      <li>bug-middling:"Entry Symbol=none" still emits -e making next
        commandline arg be the entry symbol. I don't need an entry symbol so I
        shouldn't have to dummy one up.</li>
      <li>bug-minor: '-u_vector' is put into ld commandline, but I am not using
        that for my vector table (using KEEP's instead). This used to be
        accessible from the properties editor but I can't find it therein.</li>
      <li>tedious: after breaking debug: frequently prompted to find a header
        file, even when the file open dialog has that file handy. Doesn't
        remember these selections very long, makes debug sessions tedious. I
        believe I can add header files to the project file, but as indicated by
        your "open include" right click menu you can sometimes&nbsp; find the
        files yourself.</li>
      <li>RFI: allow placing backup files in another directory, instead of same
        directory as file, to reduce clutter when browsing the source with a
        file manager, especially useful when grepping for something- you only
        get hits in files that matter without having to use a fancy glob ('.h'
        or '.cpp'). The same would be nice for autosave files.</li>
      <li>RFI: open file dialog should watch for files being added (by external
        actions)</li>
      <li>RFI: open file dialog should remember last file filter, or allow you
        to configure a default. The existing default is wrong 100% of the time
        for me, at least when invoked by ^O. It seems that sometimes it
        remembers, sometimes not. It recently got obsessed with .ld files.</li>
      <li>package error: cannot find
        /home/andyh/.rowley_associates_limited/CrossWorks for
        ARM/v3/packages/targets/LPC1000/lib/liblpc1000_v7m_t_le_eabi_f_swc.a: No
        such file or directory<br>
        'small' is present, but no 'swc' variant. I selected treat double as
        float, don't know which other properties affect lib selection. The lib
        wasn't useful to me at this time.</li>
      <li>with every C level debug step the memory window was scrolled back to
        its left margin, requiring me to yank it back each and every step to see
        the value I wanted. You should not be automatedly fooling with window
        scrollbars, that is extremely painful to deal with. Over the years
        crossworks also has had a tendency to change the expansion state of a
        tree with every step into another function and return, that also makes
        my wrists ache during any extended debug session and is a major time
        killer and distraction. And ditto that for the display format of members
        of a struct or a local variable.<br>
        Summary: View state should not be altered during a data update, view
        state of locals should be remembered by function, not in sync with the
        stack as it executes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>previous version bugs to confirm:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>BUG: debug view displays base class data from address offset, rather
        than this+offset.</li>
      <li>gui: menu popup can be off screen, greatly reducing their utility.
        Tested with dual monitor system with a tall monitor on the left and a
        shorter monitor on the right. Seems to presume that the monitors are all
        the same height.</li>
      <li>gui: see above- case is cycle counter right click menu, all off screen
        except for enough to tell that a menu is present.</li>
      <li>gui: with a large project opening up the dependent files node of the
        last entry pushed its content off screen</li>
