    <p>crosstudio 3.3.1 evaluation</p>
    <ol>
      <li>clicking on linker error tries to display the linker executable, the
        linker script would seem to be a better choice (or do nothing since the
        error is correctly marked in the ld file)</li>
      <li>usability: could not find project property for preprocessor defines,
        had to hack the xml and copy section from configuration block after
        which the option appeared under the project.</li>
      <li>RFI: would like to disable all printf/scanf/widechar functionality, or
        at least bundle those in a subsection for easier ignoring.</li>
      <li>RFI: "no heap" setting, no heap allocation (or symbol stuffing) and
        stack is set to remainder of SRAM segment (via startup in my case)</li>
      <li>RFI: precalculate ram allocations and use that to put stack at start
        of ram segment, so that stack overflow is a hardfault.</li>
      <li>text editor: unhandled control keys become ordinary keys: ctrl- is '-'
        (expected font to shrink), ctrl. is '.' instead of halting execution.
        (since 1.17!)</li>
      <li>build: concatenation of configuration names is done with a space char,
        making commandline file management annoying.</li>
      <li>"Entry Symbol=none" still emits -e making next commandline arg be the
        entry symbol. I don't need an entry symbol so I shouldn't have to dummy
        one up.</li>
      <li>linker invoked with --OMAGIC, I'd like to be able to control that, but
        see "Entry Symbol" issue for why this came to my attention.</li>
      <li>frequently prompted to find a header file, even when the file open
        dialog has that file handy. Doesn't remember these selections very long,
        makes debug sessions tedious. I believe I can header files to the
        project file, but as indicated by your "open include" right click menu
        you can find the files yourself.</li>
      <li>RFI: allow placing backup files in another directory, instead of same
        directory as file, to reduce clutter when browsing the source with a
        file manager, especially useful when grepping for something- you only
        get hits in files that matter without having to use a fancy glob ('.h'
        or '.cpp'). The same would be nice for autosave files.</li>
      <li>RFI: open file dialog should watch for files being added (by external
        actions)</li>
      <li>RFI: open file dialog should remember last file filter, or allow you
        to configure a default. The existing default is wrong 100% of the time
        for me, at least when invoked by ^O.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>previous version bugs to confirm:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>BUG: debug view displays base class data from address offset, rather
        than this+offset.</li>
      <li>gui: menu popup can be off screen, greatly reducing their utility.
        Tested with dual monitor system with a tall monitor on the left and a
        shorter monitor on the right. Seems to presume that the monitors are all
        the same height.</li>
      <li>gui: see above- case is cycle counter right click menu, all off screen
        except for enough to tell that a menu is present.</li>
      <li>with a large project opening up the dependent files node of the last
        entry pushed its content off screen</li>
      <li><br>
