## make a script that will rebuild links to external files
# this is needed as arduino insists on incorporating 100% of the .h and .cpp files it finds inteh project directory.
# the 'add file' feature of the IDE *copies* the file into the current directory
# there is also no easy way to have a per-project list of include paths and lib paths. With difficulty one can set that up for all projects via editing a properties file in a hard to find location.

find . -type l -exec readlink {} \+ >externals.list

rm -f importer

while read extname; do 
  echo >>importer ln -sf $extname 
  #this gets done too many places, will do this manually at need: echo >>.gitignore $(basename $extname) 
done <externals.list

## occasionally do the following:
# find . -type l -exec echo >>.gitignore {} \;
